<p> <font face="arial" color="blue" >HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, serves as the standard markup language for creating web pages and defining their structure.</p>
<p><font face="brush script" color="yellow">It utilizes a system of elements and tags, enclosed in angle brackets, to organize content such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Web browsers interpret these tags to display the content in a visually organized manner, rather than showing the tags themselves.</p>
<p><font face="times new roman" color="violet">HTML forms the foundational "skeleton" of a webpage, upon which styling (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript) are built. It is a constantly evolving language, managed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring its continued relevance in web development.</p>
