<p>Fruits are the edible, sweet or sour parts of plants that usually contain seeds. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, making them an important part of a healthy diet. Common examples include apples, bananas, oranges, mangoes, and berries. Fruits can be eaten fresh, dried, or used in juices, desserts, and cooking.
