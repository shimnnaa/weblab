<p>Flowers are the colorful and fragrant parts of a plant that are often used for reproduction. They attract insects and birds with their scent and color, helping in pollination. Flowers come in many shapes, sizes, and colors, such as roses, lilies, sunflowers, and tulips. They are often used in decoration, gifts, and ceremonies, and some are even used for making perfumes, medicines, or teas. Flowers add beauty to nature and bring joy to people.</p>
