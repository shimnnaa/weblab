<p>Trees are large, perennial plants with a strong trunk, branches, and leaves. They play a vital role in the environment by producing oxygen, providing shade, preventing soil erosion, and supporting wildlife. Trees also offer fruits, wood, and other resources useful to humans. Common types include oak, mango, pine, and neem. They help improve air quality and add beauty to the surroundings, making them essential for a healthy ecosystem.</p>
